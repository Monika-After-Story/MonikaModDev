# Historical data module
#
# How this works:
#   Historical data is persistent data over time.
#
# ORGANIZED:
#   dicts of dicts:
#   <year> : <subdict>
#       year - just the 4/5 digit year (2018, 2017, and so on)
#       subdict - as follows:
#           <data key> : <data value>
#               data key - key to identify this data. See below for layout
#               data value - value to save
#
# DATA KEY LAYOUT:
#   data keys need to follow a structure so we can ensure uniqueness:
#   <topic category>.<sub category>.<sub sub category>...<name>
#   EX: o31.activity.tricktreat.went_outside
#   topic category - main topic category
#       o31 - halloween
#       d25 - chms
#       922 - monika bday
#       player_bday - player bday
#       pm - player model
#       and so on
#   sub category - fine tuned category if needed
#   sub sub category - even more fine tuned category if needed
#   ...
#   name - variable name. this should be pretty descriptive
#
#   You don't need to use the sub categories if you dont need them.
#   However, topic category is REQUIRED
#
# MAPPING
#   Data saving is done by mapping a persistent variable name (as string) to
#   the data key (as string).
#   NOTE: we do NOT just use the persistent variable name as data key in the
#       event that we wnat to save a non-persistent variable.
#
# MAPPING STORAGE
#   New class called MASHistorySaver, contains a datetime and a mapping,
#   as well as the callbacks/programming points for a mapping.
#   Also contains an ID for uniqueness. We use that ID in saving data.
#
#   The datetime determines the next time the mapping is saved. This will be
#   auto adjusted to the next year. We also scan through datetimes and fix
#   times that are beyond 1 year ahead (in the case of time traveling)
#
#   MASHistorySaver data is saved into a dict of tuples. We use the ID for key.
#
# CALLBACKS:
#   When data mapping is done, there is option to run entry/exit programming
#   points. Not sure if this is really helpful but we'll see.
#
# RUN:
#   All MASHistorySaver objects are checked at init -800. This is designed to
#   be run after persistent backup system is run, but before lots of other
#   things.
#   The datetimes of each object are checked and if the current date is
#   past this datetime we run the data save. This uses the mapping to save
#   appropriate data into the historical dict.
#
#   All persistent variables that were saved are then set to None. This preps
#   them for default values later in the pipeline
#
# STORAGE:
#   all historical data is saved in `persistent._mas_history_archives`
#   access is given via public functions. DO NOT ACCESS DIRECTLY
#
#   MASHistorySaver object data is stored in `persistent._mas_history_mhs_data`
#   NEVER ACCESS THIS IN RUNTIME
#
#   MASHistorySaver objects are created on start and stored in `mhs_db`
#   Access is given via public functions. DO NOT ACCESS DIRECTLY
#
# CREATION:
#   All MASHistorySaver objects should be created before init level -800.
#   Tuple persistent data is loaded at -800, then the algorithms are ran.
