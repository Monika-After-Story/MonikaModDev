##This page holds all of the random greetings that Monika can give you after you've gone through all of her "reload" scripts

#Make a list of every label that starts with "greeting_", and use that for random greetings during startup

# HOW GREETINGS USE EVENTS:
#   unlocked - determines if the greeting can even be shown
#   rules - specific event rules are used for things:
#       MASSelectiveRepeatRule - repeat on certain year/month/day/whatever
#       MASNumericalRepeatRule - repeat every x time
#       MASPriorityRule - priority of this event. if not given, we assume
#           the default priority (which is also the lowest)

# PRIORITY RULES:
#   Special, moni wants/debug greetings should have negative priority.
#   special event greetings should have priority 10-50
#   non-special event, but somewhat special compared to regular greets should
#       be 50-100
#   random/everyday greetings should be 100 or larger. The default prority
#   will be 500

# persistents that greetings use
default persistent._mas_you_chr = False

# persistent containing the greeting type
# that should be selected None means default
default persistent._mas_greeting_type = None

# cutoff for a greeting type.
# if timedelta, then we add this time to last session end to check if the
#   type should be cleared
# if datetime, then we compare it to the current dt to check if type should be
#   cleared
default persistent._mas_greeting_type_timeout = None

default persistent._mas_idle_mode_was_crashed = None
# this gets to set to True if the user crashed during idle mode
# or False if the user quit during idle mode.
# in your idle greetings, you can assume that it will NEVER be None
