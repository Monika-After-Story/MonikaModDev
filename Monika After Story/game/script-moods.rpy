# moods system will be attached to the talk button

#   fucking brilliant

#   1. monika says something about it

# all moods should be available at the start

#   BAD > NETRAL > GOOD
# (priority thing?)

# Implementation plan:
#
# Event Class:
#   prompt - button prompt
#   category - acting as a type system, similar to jokes
#       NOTE: only one type allowed for moods ([0] will be retrievd)
#   unlocked - True, since moods are unlocked by default
