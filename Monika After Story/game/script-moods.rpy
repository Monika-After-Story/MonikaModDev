# moods system will be attached to the talk button

# and then the responses are like:
#   hungry
#   sick
#   tired
#   happy
#   fucking brilliant
#   and so on
#
# When a mood is selected:
#   1. monika says something about it
#   2. (stretch) other dialogue is affected
#
# all moods should be available at the start
#
# 3 types of moods:
#   BAD > NETRAL > GOOD
# (priority thing?)

# Implementation plan:
#
# Event Class:
#   prompt - button prompt
#   category - acting as a type system, similar to jokes
#       NOTE: only one type allowed for moods ([0] will be retrievd)
#   unlocked - True, since moods are unlocked by default
