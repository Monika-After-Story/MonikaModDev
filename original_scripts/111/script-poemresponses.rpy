    mc "How so?"
    m 1a "No, not the poem..."
    m 2a "I mean, it's funny how your poems and Sayori's poems have been getting more and more similar to each other every day."
    m "I'm surprised you're so in sync with her."
    m 2d "Then again, you've been spending a lot of time together lately, haven't you?"
    mc "Ah, I guess you could say that..."
    mc "Although we kind of grew up as best friends, I haven't been seeing as much of her this past year..."
    mc "But since I joined the club, we've been spending a lot of time together again."
    m 1a "I see, I see~"
    m "That reminds me..."
    m "About how Sayori's been a little bit off today..."
    mc "Yeah? Did she tell you something?"
    m 1n "Ah..."
    m "Well..."
    m 2l "[player], you haven't been flirting with her, have you?"
    mc "O-Of course not!"
    mc "I've been treating her like I always do."
    m 2a "Alright."
    m 5 "Just making sure~"
    m "I know how much you care about her..."
    m "It would be terrible if something bad happened to her, so keep an eye on her."
    m 2d "Sayori's been acting so much happier ever since you joined the club."
    m "What could have happened all of a sudden...?"
    mc "..."
    m 1l "...Well, never mind."
    m "This really isn't the time to be talking about this..."

    m "Yuri's been teaching you a lot of things, hasn't she?"
    mc "Well--"
    mc "I guess so."
    m 2a "Yeah... I've been noticing how much time you spend with her."
    m 2d "I think I've heard her say more words these past couple days than she's talked in the whole year."
    m "Not sure how you did it, but that's pretty impressive..."
    mc "Well, she just needs some patience and a way to talk about all the things in her head, I guess..."
    mc "I'm still getting the hang of it, myself."
    m 2a "Hm..."
    m "You're certainly putting in a lot of effort."
    m 2e "You must really like her."
    mc "Eh? That's--"
    m 5 "Ahaha!"
    m "It's awfully suspicious, you know?"
    m "Spending time with her in the clubroom every day..."
    m "Reading that edgy novel with her..."
    mc "Well--!"
    mc "I just...feel bad that she has a hard time socializing."
    mc "It makes me want to make sure she doesn't spend all her time alone."
    mc "Besides, the novel isn't too bad either, you know..."
    m 1k "Alright, alright~"
    m "I get you."
    m 1a "Just...be careful, alright?"
    m "I know that Yuri isn't used to opening herself up..."
    m 2d "So if something bad happens while she's vulnerable..."
    m "Then it could be really hard for her."
    m 2i "Her books aren't a total escape from reality."
    m "They're just a bandage."
    mc "You say that like I'm going to hurt her..."
    m 1l "Sorry, I didn't really mean that~"
    m "If anything, she might accidentally hurt herself."
